\chapter{If/Else If/Else}

Any non-trivial program will use what is called a "conditional". A conditional
is a decision. A boolean truth or falsity. Like many other languages, this is
performed with an \verb|if| statement.

Let's take a look at an example so that we may dissect it.

\begin{code}{ifelse1.c}
#include <stdio.h>

void main ()
{
    int a = 100;

    if (a == 100) {
        printf ("%d is == 100\n", a);
    }
}
\end{code}

\begin{Terminal}
gcc ifelse1.c
./a.out
100 is == 100
\end{Terminal}
