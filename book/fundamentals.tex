\chapter{Fundamentals}

This chapter will familiarize you with the syntax and terminology of the C
language, as well as the process of reading and writing C code.

Understanding the fundamentals of C is critical to your success as a GNOME
developer. If you have a strong understanding of the basics, no challenge will 
be unsurmountable with the right amount of patience and determination.

Today, you start on those fundamentals. Let's get things going by looking at
some C code and familiarizing ourselves with its anatomy.


\begin{code}{figure1.c}
\input{fundamentals1}
\end{code}

TODO
\begin{enumerate}
\item \verb|#include <glib.h>|
\item \verb|gint|
\item \verb|(gint argc, gchar *argv[])|
\item \verb|{|
\item \verb|    gint age;|
\item \verb|    return 0;|
\item \verb|}|
\end{enumerate}

TODO: The whole following is not easy to understand or deduce, but it
starts covering the sections, which can be elaborated on.

Lets look at the first line: \verb|#include <glib.h>|. This line includes
the \ident{header} \verb|glib.h|. A \ident{header} is a file that describes
various components of C code. \verb|glib.h|, in particular, describes many
of the core components we will use on the GNOME desktop.

TODO: More info on headers. Maybe we should save it for later?

The next line of code: \verb|gint| contains the \ident{return type} for the
function called main.

Following the type we have \verb|main|, the name of the function that is
called when the program starts.

TODO: what does "calling a function" even mean at this point?



TODO: Lots of explaination on the anatomy of figure 1.


\section{Arithmetic}

Every computer language, at some point, is working with numbers and basic
arithmetic. Thankfully, you don't have to be good at mathematics to be a good
programmer. But we should have a knowledge of the basics. Performing arithmetic
in the C programming language should feel similar to what you already do when
writing equations on a piece of paper.

Addition is performed with the \ident{+} operator and subtraction with the
\ident{-} operator. Multiplication is performed with the \ident{*} operator and
division with the \ident{/} operator. Determining the remainder of division can
be found with the \ident{\%}, "modulus", operator.

TODO: examples of the arithmetic.

\subsection{Order of Operations}

Just like you may have learned in beginning algebra, parenthesis can be used
to alter the order of operations.

TODO: explain the order of operations.

\section{Student Exercises}

Complete the following exercises. Each exercise is designed to enforce the
lessons described in this chapter.


\subsection{Exercise 1}
Complete the following source code to calculate how old the user will be this
year based on the year they were born. Use the constant \verb|THIS\_YEAR| in
the arithmetic and store the result in \verb|now|.

\begin{code}{exercise1.c}
\input{exercise1}
\end{code}
\footnotesize
\input{exercise1.out}

\subsection{Exercise 2}
Complete the following source code to perform basic division on a number
provided by a user.

\begin{code}{exercise2.c}
