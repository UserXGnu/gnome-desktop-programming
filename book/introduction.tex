\chapter{Introduction}

Your presence here is important. You have made the choice to remove the magic
curtains from your computing experience by learning the low-level computer
programming language, C. The history of C is long, and can be much better
explained in other mediums. Many changes to the language have occurred over
the past 40 years. This book aims to teach you the C programming language as
it is today, only explaining ancient portions when it provides a better
understanding of the now.

This book covers the C programming languages, from the very basics to advanced
concepts. But more than that, it is a companion for your journey in Linux and
the GNOME Desktop. Once we have a grasp of the language we will learn the
components available to us and how to use them effectively. We will cover the
concepts behind the choices. We will take note of designs and concepts have
not served us well and learn from them.

The next phase of our journey is one of preparation.


\section{Preparing the System}

To write software for a particular platform, such as GNOME, you need an SDK
(Software Developers Kit). And SDK contains information about the platform. It
typically includes a compiler, headers, and other associated files. A compiler
is a program that takes source code, and translates it into a language that the
computer knows. If it cannot understand it, it will not be able to translate it
and the compiler will try to give us a hint as to what went wrong. “headers”
contain information about the programs on our computer. It gives us insight
into how the programs were written. When we want to make use of existing
software on the system, we use that existing softwares "headers" to prime the
compiler as to how it works. The compiler than then take we we told it along
with what it learned from the headers to translate our program!


\section{Installing the SDK}

GNOME contains many pieces of software written by many different groups of
people. We need a compiler, headers, and associated tools for building
software. To get those, we will use our Linux distributions package manager to
install the required components.

It is important to be comfortable with a terminal for software development. A
terminal is essential to the process of software development. So get those
terminals going! I use gnome-terminal, but everyone has there favorite; xterm
for example.

We also need a text editor to use to write our code. Every programmer has their
favorite. I, love using VIM in a terminal. Many C programmers love Emacs. And
some GNOME programmers are perfectly happy in Gedit. For this book, I will
assume you are using Gedit, because the VIM and Emacs users probably know their
way around their editor just fine.
