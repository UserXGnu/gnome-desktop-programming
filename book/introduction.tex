\chapter{Introduction}

Your presence here is important. You have made the choice to remove the magic
curtains from your computing experience by learning the low-level computer
programming language, C. The history of C is long, and can be much better
explained in other mediums. Many changes to the language have occurred over
the past 40 years. This book aims to teach you the C programming language as
it is today, only explaining ancient portions when it provides a better
understanding of the now.

This book covers the C programming languages, from the very basics to advanced
concepts. But more than that, it is a companion for your journey in Linux and
the GNOME Desktop. Once we have a grasp of the language we will learn the
components available to us and how to use them effectively. We will cover the
concepts behind the choices. We will take note of designs and concepts have
not served us well and learn from them.

The next phase of our journey is one of preparation.
