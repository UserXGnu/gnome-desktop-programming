TODO: numbers with decimals
TODO: printf with %lf

\section{Student Exercise}

Use what you have learned this chpater to print the division of two decimal
numbers. Use the numbers provided in the example below to test your
implementation. Error handling is not required in this exercise. Chapter 1 used
\verb|%d| inside of the call to \verb|printf|. In this exercise, use \verb|%lf|
instead.

\begin{code}{student2.c}
#include <stdio.h>

void main ()
{
    double a;
    double b;

    printf ("Enter two decimal numbers to multiply: ");
    scanf ("%lf %lf", &a, &b);

    /* TODO: Print the division of a and b. */
}
\end{code}

When complete, the output should look like the following.

\begin{Terminal}
gcc student2.c
./a.out
Enter two decimal numbers to multiply: 12.3 45.6
12.3 / 45.6 = 0.269737
./a.out
Enter two decimal numbers to multiply: 71 873646.999
71.000000 / 873646.999000 = 0.000081
\end{Terminal}

\subsection{Extra Credit}

Some division is simply not possible. What possible input could a user provide
that would result in this problem?
