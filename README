			   GNOME Desktop Programming
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository contains the source for a book I am in the process of writing.
It is targeted at those that want to become developers for the GNOME platform
but are unsure of how to go about doing that.

The target language is C, as that will get you the most distance for your
effort. Eventually, other books could cover the same topics but for other
programming languages.

I intend for this book to evolve with the platform. I would like it to be a
resource that could be shipped with a GNOME OS installation DVD someday.

 Building The Book
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You will need the "pdflatex" binary in your path. Sometimes, this is in a
"tex-live" package. You will also need the pygments python package installed.
If your system does not have it packaged, try "easy_install pygments".
