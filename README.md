# GNOME Desktop Programming

GNOME Desktop Programming is a book for those that want to write software for
Linux and GNOME in particular. It targets the C programming language but may
someday include other languages based on its popularity.

Feel free to fork this book and start on chapters yourself if you feel
competent in a particular subject. The book has an outline for what I would
like to cover.

## Audience

The audience for this book are people who have a basic knowledge of the C
programming language and are interested in Linux, GNOME, and writing quality
software. If you do not feel you are competent in C, I suggest you join GNOME
University to work on that aspect first. GNOME University started as part of
this book, but I soon learned it would grow out of scope.

## Topics

GNOME Desktop Programming will cover the things that are most important to
those who want to read it. If you would like to suggest a topic or work on one,
fork and add it or submit an issue on github.
